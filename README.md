# Each section of the defline is separated by the "|" (pipe) symbol. Here's what each part represents:

    ENST00000641515.2: This is likely an identifier for a transcript (mRNA) sequence. The specific format and prefix "ENST" suggest that this is from the Ensembl database, which provides information about gene transcripts.

    ENSG00000186092.7: This is an identifier for the gene associated with the transcript. The prefix "ENSG" also indicates it's from the Ensembl database.

    OTTHUMG00000001094.4: This appears to be another identifier, possibly from a different database, that refers to the gene.

    OTTHUMT00000003223.4: This might be yet another identifier, possibly specific to the transcript or transcript variant.

    OR4F5-201: This could be the specific name or identifier for the transcript variant.

    OR4F5: This might be the gene name or symbol (also known as the gene ID).

    2618: This could be the length of the sequence in base pairs.

    UTR5:1-60: This indicates the position of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA sequence, which starts at position 1 and ends at position 60.

    CDS:61-1041: This indicates the position of the coding sequence (CDS) of the mRNA sequence, which starts at position 61 and ends at position 1041.

    UTR3:1042-2618: This indicates the position of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA sequence, which starts at position 1042 and ends at position 2618.
